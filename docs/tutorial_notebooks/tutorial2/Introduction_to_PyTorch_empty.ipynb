        "Welcome to the PyTorch tutorial for the Recent Trends in Deep Learning course 2021 at the University of MÃ¼nster. This notebook is a modified fork of the great [PyTorch tutorial for the Deep Learning course 2021 at the University of Amsterdam](https://github.com/phlippe/uvadlc_notebooks/tree/master/docs/tutorial_notebooks/tutorial2)! It is meant to give a short introduction to PyTorch basics, and get you setup for writing your own neural networks. PyTorch is an open source machine learning framework that allows you to write your own neural networks and optimize them efficiently. Alternatives to PyTorch include [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax#quickstart-colab-in-the-cloud) and [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/). As many of the recent papers we discuss in this seminar published their code in PyTorch, we think you will profit from understanding the basic concepts behind it. Additionally, if you know one machine learning framework in depth, it is very easy to learn another one because many of them use the same concepts and ideas. \n",

For instance, for BCE, PyTorch has two modules: `nn.BCELoss()`, `nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()`. While `nn.BCELoss` expects the inputs $x$ to be in the range $[0,1]$, i.e. the output of a sigmoid, `nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss` combines a sigmoid layer and the BCE loss in a single class. This version is numerically more stable than using a plain Sigmoid followed by a BCE loss because of the logarithms applied in the loss function. Hence, it is adviced to use loss functions applied on \"logits\" where possible (remember to not apply a sigmoid on the output of the model in this case!). For our model defined above, we therefore use the module `nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss`. "

        "Finally, you are all set to start with your own PyTorch project! In summary, we have looked at how we can build neural networks in PyTorch, and train and test them on data. However, there is still much more to PyTorch we haven't discussed. If you are already interested in learning more of PyTorch, we recommend the official [tutorial website](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/) that contains many tutorials on various topics. Especially logging with Tensorboard ([official tutorial here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/tensorboard_tutorial.html)) is a good practice that we highly recommend to track your own experiments."
